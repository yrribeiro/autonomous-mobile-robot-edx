% PART 1 How many elements does this row-vector comprise of? = 5
% --------------
% PART 2
% Filter F below can be decomposed as F=col_vector*row_vector
F = [1 4 6 4 1; 4 16 24 16 4; 6 24 36 24 6; 4 16 24 16 4; 1 4 6 4 1];

% Fill in the expressions below
row_vector = [1 4 6 4 1];
col_vector = [1 4 6 4 1]';
