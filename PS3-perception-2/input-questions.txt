Problem 1
Given the information above:
• Calculate the focal length (in pixels) along X axis.
• Calculate the focal length (in pixels) along Y axis.
• And construct the camera intrinsic matrix (K)
Answer
Let αx and αy are focal lengths in pixel.
αx · tan 30◦ = 640/2 px
αy · tan 22.5◦ = 480/2 px
Thus, αx = 554.2px, αy = 579.4px

Camera intrinsic matrix is defined as follows:
K = [[αx 0 u0], [0 αy v0], [0 0 1]]
K = [[554.2 0 230], [0 579.41 240], [0 0 1]]

Problem 2
The image point p has pixel coordinates (360, 302). If we translate the camera by the vector
T = [0.2, 0.0, 0.0]T meters and take another picture, the point appears at image position
(330, 302). Assuming that the first camera frame acts as the world reference frame, estimate
the position of point P in 3D coordinates.
~ question gives the formula, is just replacing values and transposing matrices...
