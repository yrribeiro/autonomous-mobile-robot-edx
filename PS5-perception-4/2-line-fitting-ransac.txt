Problem 1
Suppose that you are given a point cloud of 1000 points, 20% of which are inliers and
a function “one RANSAC iteration”, which performs one iteration of RANSAC on a given
set of points.
How many times do you need to call this function (i.e. how many RANSAC iterations are
required) to find at least one set of all inliers with probability p = 95% ? You may assume
that the set of points is large such that the portion of outliers do not change when removing
a point.

The number of RANSAC iteration is as follows:
k= log(1 − p) / log(1 − w^2)

where success probability p = 0.95, inlier ration w = 0.2 and the number of data points
n = 1000 (the number of RANSAC iteration is independent on the number of data points).
The number of iterations required is: k ≥ 73.3

Problem 2
If instead of selecting a pre-specified number of iterations, we performed RANSAC iterations
indefinitely then all the possible line candidates would have been checked. How may possible
line candidates are there in this dataset?

Exhaustive search takes
[n

candidates thus
[1000

=
(1000*999)/2 = 499500
